[features]
# selinux crate has a feature "selinux" is stupid, but I didn't find a good way to allow us not to
# build libs/selinux when we just call `cargo build --all`. I have tried removing libs/selinux from
# the root Cargo.toml and marking selinux as `optional = true` in libs/basic/Cargo.toml, either way
# doesn't work fine.
