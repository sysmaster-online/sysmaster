# These rules can delete partitions devnodes for slave devices
# for certain aggregate devices such as multipath.
# This is desirable to avoid confusion and keep the number
# of device nodes and symlinks within limits.
#
# This is done only once on the first "add" or "change" event for
# any given device.
#
# To suppress this, use the kernel parameter "dont_del_part_nodes",
# or create an udev rule file that sets ENV{DONT_DEL_PART_NODES}="1".
